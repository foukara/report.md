Detailed Methodology & Walkthrough
Data Collection:

Hot wallets and gas suppliers from major centralized exchanges (CEX) like Binance, Coinbase, Kucoin, Bybit, and OKX were gathered using blockchain explorers.
Using a Dune SQL query, approximately 2.5 million CEX deposit addresses were collected. These are the addresses where users send assets to deposit into a CEX.
Filtering and Clustering:

With a Dune Dashboard, CEX deposit addresses that received funds from at least seven addresses regularly interacting with Layer Zero were filtered.
Clusters of active Layer Zero addresses sharing the same CEX deposit address were created, ranging from 7 to 300 addresses.
Larger clusters were formed using a script, incorporating addresses that interacted with cluster addresses but not with the CEX deposit address. An address needed to be directly linked to at least four other cluster addresses to join.
Clusters with fewer than 20 addresses (including the CEX deposit address) were discarded.
First Layer of Detection/Proof:

This automated process identified clusters with addresses sharing the same CEX deposit address, linked to at least four other cluster addresses.
Despite being automated, this layer has a small percentage of false positives due to multiple interactions and common CEX deposit addresses.
Second Layer of Detection/Proof:

Each cluster underwent manual scanning to remove false positives and add on-chain arguments to the cluster description.
On-chain arguments included executing the same transaction at the same time with the same amounts, similar transaction patterns for Layer Zero activities, etc.
Resources used: LayerZero Scan, Dune, Debank, Arkham, Etherscan, among others.
This manual process, though time-consuming, ensures the detection of Sybil clusters and minimizes false positives. It also demonstrates thorough verification beyond a mere list of addresses.
Screening Across Blockchains:

Activity was screened across 14 blockchains:
Ethereum (endblock 19757726)
Optimism (endblock 119326917)
BSC (endblock 38236464)
Polygon (endblock 56379454)
Arbitrum (endblock 205653169)
Gnosis (endblock 33677943)
Linea (endblock 4059728)
Scroll (endblock 5184468)
Zksync (endblock 32656745)
Moonbeam (endblock 6045324)
Moonriver (endblock 6637617)
FTM (endblock 80127182)
Base (endblock 13709885)
Celo (endblock 25273962)
Arkham Diagrams:
Arkham supports only 7 out of the 14 blockchains used in this report, leading to occasional missing links in Arkham diagrams.

Conclusion:
The combination of automated and manual detection processes, thorough screening across multiple blockchains, and the use of various resources ensures high accuracy in identifying Sybil clusters with minimal false positives. This rigorous methodology underpins the credibility and reliability of the findings presented in this report.

Reported Addresses & Description
CLUSTER 1

The first 9 addresses of the cluster share the same OKX deposit address 0x0d5eA059602029Dda50c3DD96609d086307e2E3A. The rest are linked to numerous addresses of the cluster, multiple times.

The addresses have the same L0 age (date of first L0 interaction), 751 days ago, aswell as similar amount bridge, contract count, number of unique days/weeks/months etc...
